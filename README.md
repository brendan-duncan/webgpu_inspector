# WebGPU Inspector

Inspection debugger for WebGPU

## Development

This is very much a work in progress, and is not ready for use.

To use it for development:

- In Chrome, open **chrome://extensions**
- Enable Developer Mode (switch in top-right corner)
- Press **Load Unpacked** button
- Browse to **<webgpu_inspector directory>/extensions** and press **Select Folder**

---

- On the page to inspect, press the puzzle piece icon on the address bar, and select **webgpu-inspector**.
  - The icon for that extension will go from red to blue, indicating it's enabled.

## TODO

- This is ugly prototype code, so pretty much everything is TODO
